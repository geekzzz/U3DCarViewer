		- Fix wobble when using rotation gesture and panning object at the same time.
		- Rename some script files, this should not cause any problems but let me know if you see any strange errors.

2.2.5	(2018-03-20)

2.2.2	(2018-02-25)
		- Fix dpad image pixel offset errors.
		- Make multi drag component script, used by demo scene multi drag.

2.2.1	(2018-02-18)
		- Add FingersZoomPanCamera script. This is now used in DemoSceneZoomPanCamera and allows setting a VisibleArea collider to clamp the visible area.

2.2.0	(2018-02-15)
		- Update multi drag scene to set the platform specific view and make one pan gesture per asteroid.
		- Gestures by default are now allowed to execute simultaneously if the platform specific view properties are not equal to each other. This can be changed via AllowSimultaneousExecutionIfPlatformSpecificViewsAreDifferent property. You can always allow gestures to execute simultaneously regardless of the platform specific view by calling AllowSimultaneousExecution methods.

2.1.6	(2018-02-12)
		- Add multi drag demo scene to show dragging multiple objects with multiple touches at the same time.

2.1.5	(2018-01-31)

		- Add OrbitXPan and OrbitYPan booleans to orbit script to allow the camera to slide instead of orbit.
		- Add AllowMovementOnBothAxisSimultaneously parameter to orbit script.

2.1.2	(2017-12-15)
		- Add new EndMode property to swipe gesture, giving three different possible types of end swipe behavior. See SwipeGestureRecognizerSwipeMode for more details.

2.1.1	(2017-12-12)
		- Update demo scene swipe to show that only the end immediately parameter is needed for multiple swipes without lifting a finger.

2.1.0	(2017-12-06)
		- Add ability for FingersPanRotateScaleScript to affect many game objects with one script. See DemoScenePanRotateScaleManyWithOneGesture for an example.

2.0.5	(2017-12-04)
		- Fixes for iOS, timings were slightly off, so switched everything to use System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch. This should fix tap requiring double tap to fail on iOS.

2.0.4	(2017-12-01)
		- Fixed for tap gesture recognizer.
		- Allow multiple gestures to be required to fail for a gesture to end.

2.0.3	(2017-11-15)
		- Add eight axis mode for joystick script to only allow exactly 8 directions.

2.0.2	(2017-11-10)
		- Improve the ability to continue gestures without lifting touches. See DemoSceneSwipe / DemoScriptSwipe.cs.

2.0.1	(2017-11-08)
		- Added TapTouches property to TapGestureRecognizer. This will keep track of every touch involved in the tap, even if it requires another tap to fail. Use
		   this property over CurrentTrackedTouches for the tap gesture, as CurrentTrackedTouches will get cleared out when a tap gesture requires another gesture to fail.
		- Improve ScaleXMultiplier and ScaleYMultiplier on scale gesture.

2.0.0	(2017-11-04)
		- Deprecate the Updated property on DigitalRubyShared.GestureRecognizer. StateUpdated is the preferred property and removes the redundant touches parameter, as that is
		   accessible under the CurrentTrackedTouches property of the gesture. The Updated property will be removed in a future version, so please migrate
		   to the new property ASAP.
		- Moved component gestures over to StateUpdated property. You'll need to re-wire these events up in the inspector using the new method signature without the touches parameter.
		- Fix double tap issue and multiple swipes with one gesture issue.
		- Pass Unity touch pressure to GestureTouch object.
		- Add Pressure property to DigitalRubyShared.GestureRecognizer.
		- Add scale x multiplier and scale y multiplier to scale gestures.
		- Many more bug fixes, especially for multiple touch gestures.

		- Critical bug fix, reading Unity touches was broken completely, it is fixed now.

1.9.1	(2017-10-23)
		- Change DemoSceneSwipe to allow swipes in different directions without lifting the touch. See DemoScriptSwipe for how this works.

1.9.0	(2017-10-12)
		- Moved fingers script prefab into Prefab/Resources folder. You no longer need to drag this in your scene, although you still can if you want. Everything just works.
		- Add new components for gestures, accessible from menu at top -> Component -> Fingers Gestures -> *. See DemoSceneComponents.

1.8.0	(2017-10-11)
		- Added inertia to orbit script, to allow a smooth continuation of movement after orbit gesture.
		- Added new scene, DemoSceneUIPlus3DElements to show gestures on ui elements + 3d elements in the same scene.
		- Add rotation orbit scene demo, as seen in Unity Twitch stream.

1.6.0	(2017-06-15)
		- Added joystick script. See DemoSceneJoystick.
		- Fixed a bug where platform specific view didn't work if the gesture didn't start over a game object.

1.5.2	(2017-05-10)
		- Unity 5.6 bug fixes and bug fixes for pass through logic.
		- Better handling of 3D scenes.

1.5.1	(2017-04-21)
		- Fix for buttons, toggle, dropdown, etc. passing through touches by default. They now do NOT pass through touches by default.

1.5.0	- Added FingersPanRotateScaleScript.cs and FingersDragDropScript.cs, with example scenes.
		- Swipe gesture sets executing and failed states.

1.4.0	- Added FingersImageAutomationScene. When generating large amounts of image gestures, this will copy the code automatically into a text box. When you are done drawing all the variants you can copy and paste the code out of the text box. Tap the X in the bottom right in the scene to remove the last line if you made a mistake.
		- Added Score property to ImageGestureImage. Value is 0-1.

1.3.2	- Change ImageGestureRecognizer again. It sends begin, executing and end states. It got a new ThresholdUnits property, which is the distance in units the touch must move before this gesture begins.
        - Critical bug fixes for all the gestures. I've tested a lot on iPad and Android devices to try and fix little glitches and problems with the asset.
        - Refactor TouchesBegan. It receives an enumerable collection of all beginning touches. CurrentTouches property is removed, use CurrentTrackedTouches instead inside TouchesMoved and TouchesEnded.

1.3.1	- ImageGestureRecognizer no longer sends began and executing states. Only Ended state is sent. You can tell if the state began if the gesture calls back and TouchesAreMoving is false, then the touches have just begun. If it is true, then the touches are moving.

1.3.0	- Added a demo showing a zoomable scroll view
		- Added a FingersScriptPrefab so the script can live for the lifetime of your game. See DemoScript.cs Start method.

1.2.5	- Added a way to override the anchor of the one touch rotate gesture.

1.2.4	- Pass through handler tweak: renamed to CaptureGestureHandler. A null handler or null return value uses default capture behavior, otherwise return true to capture the gesture, false to pass it through.

1.2.3	- Improvements to pass through gestures - now a parent UI element will pass through gestures to all child elements.
		- Also added a custom pass through handler function for complex cases.

1.2.2	- One finger gestures will not begin if more than one finger is down.

1.2.1	- Critical bug fixes for image gesture recognizer and image demo scene.

1.2.0	- Big refactor of code. Gestures now track touches, which means simultaneous gestures can execute on separate touches now.
		- Some properties have been removed or renamed. In DigitalRubyShared.GestureRecognizer.cs, the public properties (at the bottom of the file) are where most things can be found now.
		- Added custom image recognition gestures.

1.1.1	- Code refactoring, clear gestures when scenes change and added tutorial video link.

1.1		- Fingers can use all mouse buttons and the mouse wheel.
		- Use ctrl + wheel to pinch and shift + wheel to rotate.
		- FingersScript has Touches property and the demo adds circles for touch points.

1.0.2	- Bug fixes. conv
		- Breaking change: OnUpdated is now just Updated.

1.0.0	- Initial release.
